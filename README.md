Monty bytecodes, also known as the Monty scripting language,
are a set of instructions used in the Monty programming language.

LIFO and FIFO are two common data structures used in computer programming,
stack and heap are memory management concepts closely related to these data structures

LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):
LIFO, also known as a stack, is a data structure in which the last item inserted is the
first one to be removed. It follows the principle of "last in, first out."

The primary operations on a stack are push and pop.
Push adds an item to the top of the stack, and pop removes the top item from the stack.

FIFO (First-In, First-Out):
FIFO, also known as a queue, is a data structure in which the first item inserted is the
first one to be removed. It follows the principle of "first in, first out." 

The primary operations on a queue are enqueue and dequeue.
Enqueue adds an item to the end of the queue,
dequeue removes the item from the front of the queue.

Stack and Heap (Memory Management):
Stack and heap are two regions of memory used for managing program execution and dynamic memory allocation.

Stack:

The stack is a region of memory used to store local variables,
function call information, and other related data during program execution.
LIFO: The stack follows the LIFO principle, where the most recently allocated memory is deallocated first.

Heap:

 The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation,
where objects can be allocated and deallocated at runtime.
